                <a id="charsets"></a>Usage</h1>

            	<p>
			Quick Key can't fit all 65,000 characters on your screen at the same time, so they
		 	are organized in to logical groups called "charsets".	These are saved as .charset
			files, and are used and modified in the Character Grid.
		</p>
		<p>
			By creating personalized character sets you will save yourself time and screen space.
			Smaller, more focused groups are easier to manage, and are faster to respond
		   	Although Quick Key can display charsets with more than a few hundred characters,
			it can become unresponsive for long periods of time. 
            </p>
		
            <h1>
                <a id="includedcharsets"></a>Included Charsets</h1>
	    <p>To load a character set, click <strong>File &gt; Open</strong> on the <a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a>, and choose
		a charset. Quick Key includes about 220 charsets.</p>
		<h3>Directories</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>By Language</strong><br />Character sets by category</li>
			<li><strong>By Font</strong><br /> Font-specific character sets</li>
			<li><strong>All</strong><br /> All 65,000 chracters, split into 1024 chraracter groups</li>
			<li><strong>View Filters</strong><br /> Can be used in conjunction with charsets to apply filters.</li>
			<li><strong>Text Styles</strong><br /> Similar to View Filters, but these overlay formatting when opened instead.</li>
            </ul>
		<h3>Files</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Ascii</strong><br />The 256 characters that are almost universally supported</li>
			<li><strong>&lt;Language&gt;</strong><br />Language-optimized character groups. Contains only
			the freqently used characters for each language.</li>
		 </ul>

            <h1>
                <a id="makecharset"></a>Making your own charsets</h1>
            <p>
                Although many charsets are included by default, you may wish to create your own.
                The recommended procedure for this is to start with a larger character set that
                already has most of the characters you need, and then delete the unnecessary ones. If
                you find yourself needing a character that is not in the provided sets, press <strong>
                    Ctrl-Shift-U</strong> to add characters by decimal or hexadecimal code. Another
                feature found in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu of the <a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a>
                is the <strong>Edit Characters as Text</strong> dialog box, where the list of characters
                is placed into a normal text box for regular editing. Note, however, that text boxes
                display characters differently than the character grid does. Some characters (combining
                marks) are displayed over preceding characters, and some are only visible as squares.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tips:</strong> To quickly create a charset from an existing one, choose
                <strong>New Copy of this Charset</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu. If
                you are in possession of a document that already contains the characters you need,
                use <strong>Import from File</strong>. Use this to drag and drop (right mouse button)
                text selections to the character grid.</p>

            <p>
                Help us out! You can make your donation to the Quick Key project in the form of
                a charset. The Unicode standard defines tens of thousands of characters, and we
                are a long way from organizing all those into really useful groups. Please <a href="mailto:nathanaeljones@users.sourceforge.net">
                    email us</a> the characters sets you have customized to help you with your job;
                we will upload them to this page for everyone to enjoy. With each new release these
                files will be included.</p>

                        <h1>
                <a id="filters"></a>Filtering Character Categories</h1>
            <p>
                Filters may cause some headaches, but I think once you get used to them they will
                come in handy. Filters are categories of characters, defined by the Unicode standard,
                which can be used selectively to narrow the number of characters you see in the
                <a href="#chargrid">Character Grid</a>. For example, by default, characters in the
                categories <strong>Format, Control, Private Use, Other Not Assigned, Other Number</strong>,
                and <strong>Surrogate</strong> are hidden. These characters are unlikely to be used
                by anybody but a software developer or systems administrator. Your filter selections
                will be saved with your character set, but you can turn this off in the <strong>File</strong>
                menu. Character set files can contain any combination of <strong>Font Settings</strong>,
                <strong>Filters</strong>, and <strong>Characters</strong>. When a character set
                is opened and it does not contain one of these categories of information, the font
                settings, filters, and even characters are used from the last character set, essentially
                merging the two. Filter settings are found in the <strong>Filters</strong> menu
                on the <strong>Toolbar Form</strong>.
            </p>
			<h1>
                <a id="fontrec"></a>Picking a Font</h1>
            <p>
                Most <a href="#fonts">fonts</a> only support a small subset of the available characters;
                 for the rest they display a generic rectangle. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial_Unicode_MS">
                    Arial Unicode MS</a> supports an amazing selection of the Unicode specification.
                It contains 51,180 glyphs, and is bundled with Microsoft Word. I recommend that
                you use this font as much as possible while working with Quick Key, so that you
                can view the largest number of characters. Keep in mind, however, which font the
                destination application is using, as this will determine the result.</p>
			<h1>
                <a id="fonts"></a>All fonts are different
            </h1>
            <p>
                In Quick Key, all characters will be displayed using whatever font is currently
                selected in the Toolbar. You may notice that when a character is transferred to
                another application, the appearance or shape of the character changes. This is because
                Quick Key and the destination application are using different fonts to render the
                character. If both fonts are correctly designed, and use the <a href="http://www.unicode.org">
                    Unicode</a> standard, the only change should be the style of the character.
                If a completely different character appears, you are using a non-standard font in
                either Quick Key or the application. Always use a standardized font to ensure
                sure that the document will be readable in the future. If in doubt, change the
                font to <strong>Times New Roman</strong> and verify that the letters appear correctly.
                As Quick Key does not transfer font information along with characters, I recommend that
                you set the font to <strong>Arial Unicode MS</strong> and leave it there. This eliminates
                any confusion you may have when opening a charset and seeing <a href="#fontrec">
                    rectangles</a>.
            </p>
			            <h1>
                <a id="toolbar"></a>The Toolbar
            </h1>
            <p>
                Here you can load a different character set, save one you have modified, or change
                how characters are displayed. <a href="keystroke.html">Keywords</a> and <a href="#filters">
                    Filters</a> are controlled here. To display the toolbar, right click the <a href="#chargrid">
                        Character Grid</a> title bar or the <strong>system tray icon</strong>, and
                choose <strong>Toolbar</strong>.
            </p>
			            <h1>
                <a id="chargrid"></a>Character Grid
            </h1>
            <p>
                The character grid is what you will use when sending characters to other applications.
                Most functions can be accessed by right-clicking objects in this window. The title
                bar menu allows you to modify appearance, functionality, and open a recently used
                charset. You will also notice the two icons next to the close button. These enable
                the auto-hide and lock features respectively. The character grid displays all characters
                in the current charset that match the currently selected <a href="#filters">filters</a>.
                To move characters around, click the <strong>Drag</strong> mouse button (left) on
                a character.</p>
            <p>
                Although using right-click menus to deal with characters one-by-one is often sufficient,
                you may need to make mass deletions or modifications that require a more powerful
                method. To do this, open the <a href="#toolbar">Toolbar</a>, the click <strong>Tools</strong>><strong>Edit
                    Characters as Text</strong>. Now you can perform modifications on selections
                of characters.</p>
