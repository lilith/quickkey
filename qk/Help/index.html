Quick Key extends your keyboard, letting you type all 65,000 characters
that there are today. It does so without cluttering your screen or interfering with your work. 
To type a character, click it. Quick Key is completely free of charge, and is 
licensed under the Open Source <a href="about.html#licensing">GPL license</a>.

	Quick Key is primarily a flexible keyboard extension, although it has dozens of unique features
	that make it indispensible for developers as well as regular users. Quick Key is an alternative to
	using Microsoft Character Map or <a href="alt.html">Alt Codes</a>, both of which are difficult to use.
        Quick Key is the ideal solution for people who need to input foreign characters or mathematical
            symbols quickly, but do not want to spend time learning a new <a href="alt.html#layouts">keyboard
                layout</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>
	    <a id="gettingstarted"></a>Installation
        </h1>
        <p>
            After you have downloaded the Quick Key <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=157860&amp;package_id=176674">
                zip file</a> , you will need to unzip it using a decompression utility. For
            users of Windows XP, right click on the file and choose <strong>Extract All</strong>.
            Now double-click on <strong>setup.exe</strong> and follow the provided instructions.
            Once the installation is finished, click the <strong>Start Menu</strong>&gt;<strong>Programs</strong>&gt;<strong>Quick
                Key</strong>&gt;<strong>Quick Key</strong>. A red and black icon should appear

     <h1>
	    <a id="usage"></a>Using Quick Key
    </h1>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Quick Key</strong> supports drag-and-drop for almost everything. You can move characters
			around inside Quick Key, out of Quick Key, and into Quick Key using drag-and-drop.
			</li><li>
			<strong>Quick Key</strong> also allows you to copy and paste characters, as well as their HTML code.
			</li><li>
			<strong>Quick Key</strong> allows you to <a href="keystroke.html">
			send characters to a specific application</a> using a program code. For example, <strong>MSN Messenger</strong> is MSBLClass.
			</li><li>
			<strong>Quick Key</strong> can function as a reference for <strong>Alt codes</strong>. To see information about a symbol or letter, move your mouse over it.
			</li><li>
			<strong>Quick Key</strong> allows you to save <a href="charsets.html">
			customized groups of characters to disk</a>.
			</li><li>
			<strong>Quick Key</strong> <a href="charsets.html#filters">filters your character sets</a>,

        <p>
            Please help me make Quick Key better by reporting bugs when you find them. All I
            need is a sentence describing what was clicked when Quick Key crashed, and the contents
            of the <strong>Error Log</strong>. After you have restarted Quick Key, right click
            the icon in the system tray and choose <strong>Error Log</strong>. Make sure you
            select <strong>Last Five Instances</strong> before you copy and paste into the email.
            My email address is <a href="mailto:nathanaeljones@users.sourceforge.net">nathanaeljones@users.sourceforge.net</a></p>

            <strong>Please don't limit your feedback to bugs</strong> - I'd love to hear your
            comments, suggestions, and criticisms. If you have any ideas for this website, or
            know of something that should be included in the documentation, please let me know.
