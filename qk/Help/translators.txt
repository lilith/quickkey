Keywords are the internal code names for applications, or application classes. For example, Microsoft Word is always OpusApp, wheras Outlook Express has a different keyword (class name) for the message composer (ATH_Note) than for the main window (Outlook Express Browser Class).
To add a new keyword, you must click 'Add', then 'Find'. This opens a separate application, which will retrieve the class name once given the exact title bar text for the window.
For users of GTK+ applications, it may be neccesary to change the send mode to Clipboard + SendKeys(). This method works with a larger portion of applications, but overwrites any text or information you may store in the clipboard."

Be sure to explore the right-click menus on the title bar and the characters.
You can rearrange characters by dragging them with the middle mouse button.
If you need a different set of characters, use the File menu in the Toolbar.
For some applications, you may need to change the character transfer method in Options. This only applies to GTK+ applications."

Quick Key displays two graphical tips containing text. I extracted the text
for you below:

[The Welcome tip] (Feel free to rephrase this to make it more understandable)

Quick Key
Foreign Character Keyboard
Left click any character to type it. Mouse settings are modified in Options.
Keystrokes are sent to the last application used; however, it is better if
you manually chose which application to send to by selecting the associated
Keyword.

Tired of Tips?
Just click Hide Tips in the Help menu. The Help menu can be found by
right-clicking the icon.

Open Quick Key by right-clicking this icon:
