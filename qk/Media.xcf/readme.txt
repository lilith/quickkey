_______________________________________________________________

These files constitute the first public release of the SIL Yi Font for Windows.

After decompressing the package archive, install the font like you
would any other Windows font. Then read through the documentation
for some very important information on using the font. You will need
Adobe Acrobat Reader version 3 or later to view the documentation.
The reader is available at no cost at:  
	http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html.
	
Note: if you encounter problems reading the documentation in your browser using the Acrobat Reader plug-in, download the documentation to your disk and open it with the standalone Acrobat Reader package.	

You may (and are encouraged to) freely share this font with your
friends and co-workers, but with the following restrictions:

  - All files must be copied together, including this one.
  - No fee may be charged for the fonts.
  - They may not be used as a basis for other fonts.
  
Even though this font is freely distributable, SIL retains all
copyright and ownership of it and reserves the right to restrict its
use and distribution at any time. It may be placed on bulletin
boards, etc. but cannot be included in (or bundled with) any
commercial product including hard disks or CD-ROMs without specific
written permission.
