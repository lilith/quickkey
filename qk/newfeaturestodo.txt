The Autosize Settings should not affect the current font size (and it should not be named autosize)
If the current font size is using less than half the space, double the font size in OnPaint

There should be an Autosize setting that actually resizes the CharacterGrid to fit its contents. 
A decision must be made on whether to expand horizontally or vertically. (put it into another property).

The Dock icon should really follow the character grid around.

The Dock Icon mouse-over delay should be changeable

consider Snap-to-window code

Evaluate NGEN impact


Consider removing the tray icon altogether
