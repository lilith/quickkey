# Quick Key (2001 to 2006, RIP)

Just moved to github, since SourceForge is now injecting viruses into executables and installers...

I wrote this as an 11-year old kid to help out some friends, and haven't touched it since I was 15, so it's a bit over-engineered, and it uses windows APIs that no longer do anything. 

I daren't look at how bad my code was back then (nor do I want to read VB ever again). That said, I guess I was doing i18n earlier than most teenagers. My dead name is scattered liberally throughout. 

Don't use this. Windows has since implemented everything this program was trying to do, and it's just a waste of space. 

We now have IME, and on-screen keyboards. Use those instead.

Quick Key is more than just a virtual extension to your keyboard for typing foreign characters and symbols. It is a very powerful tool for working with fonts and character sets; 65,000 characters are organized into groups for easy reference.
